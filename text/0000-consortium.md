# CreateJS Consortium

## Summary

Set up a consortium process/team to run the CreateJS project.

## Motivation

The GSkinner team is handing the CreateJS project over to the community.
CreateJS will not live unless people actively maintain the project. A plan needs to be made clear to give them confidence that this is a wise decision.

This process was initially started here:
https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS/issues/1040

## Detailed design

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the project to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

### Mission statement

> What is is this project's mission statement

> https://producingoss.com/en/getting-started.html#mission-statement

## How we teach this

> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing patterns, or as a
wholly new one?

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the CreateJS guides must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how CreateJS is taught to new users
at any level?

> How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing users?

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on teaching CreateJS,
on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features,
on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> This section could also include prior art, that is, how other frameworks in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
