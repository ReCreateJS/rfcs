## Vision

> What is is this project's vision?

## Project Principles

### Core team onboarding


## Practices

* Test coverage can only ever increase.
* Peer review of code - approved by 2 or more core developers, other than the submitter.
* Follow semantic versioning.
* Provide backwards compatibility for as long as possible. Deprecate code, and pull it out only when major version change (such as 2.x.x -> 3.0.0)

* Stale bot to close issues if contributor is being waited on

## Questions

Answer these questions, as checklist items above.

* How do we ensure change log is always updated?
